Heat 1 tablespoon oil over medium-high heat in a large sauté pan or wok.  Add chicken and sauté for 4-5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the chicken is cooked through and no longer pink on the inside.  Use a slotted spoon to transfer the chicken to a clean plate, and set aside.

Add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil to the sauté pan, along with the bell pepper, onion, celery and garlic.  Sauté for 5-6 more minutes, stirring occasionally.

Meanwhile, as the veggies are sautéing, whisk together the soy sauce, cornstarch, oyster sauce, vinegar, black pepper and ginger in a small bowl until combined.

Once the veggies are ready go to, add the chicken and sauce mixture to the pan, and stir until the veggies and chicken are evenly coated.  Continue to cook for 1-2 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened.  Taste, and season with extra soy sauce and/or black pepper as desired.

Remove from heat, and serve immediately, sprinkled with your desired toppings.

NOTES
If you would like a spicier dish, feel free to stir in a teaspoon or two of garlic chili sauce into the sauce.
